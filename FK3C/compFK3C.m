%
% Calculate wavenumber spectra from SDM data from a three-component array.
% 
% USAGE ======================
% 
%   [P,Q,kr,kth,EVals,polstates] = compFK3C(coords,S,kgrid,method,dopolar,nsources)
%
% 
% INPUT ======================
% coords        (n,2) real. Coordiantes of n receiver locations.
% S             (3*n,3*n,L) complex. Spectral density matrices of 3n
%               sensors for L time windows
% kgrid         (K,1) real. Grid of wavenumbers to scan through.
% method        String. 'DS': conventional delay-and-sum beamforming
%               'MU': MUSIC beamforming (inverse of orthogonal distance to
%               signal subspace) 
%               'HR': Capon high-resolution beamformer (estimated number of
%               sources must be provided).
% dopolar       Logical. Use polar wavenumber search if TRUE. Avoid setting
%               this to false.
% nsources      Int. Number of sources to assume for MUSIC method. Default
%               is 1
%               
% 
% OUTPUT ======================
% P             (T,K,L) real. Array response over wave vector grid. The grid
%               search occurs over a joint wave vector and polarization
%               state grid. That 3D response is collapsed into the 2D wave
%               vector grid responses by taking the maximum of all
%               polarization states for each wave vector grid point. T is
%               the number of azimuth grid points, K is the number of wave
%               number grid points, L is the number of time windows.
% Q             (T,K,L) int. Same format as 'P', but Q(i,j,k) gives the
%               index of the polarization state that corresponds to the output
%               in P(i,j,k).
% kr            (K,1) real. Wave number grid points [/m]
% kth           (T,1) real. Azimuth grid points (cratesian system) [rad]
% EVals         (3*n,L) real. Eigenvalues of the SDM for each time window.
% polstates     (p,4) real. Gives the polarization angles and ellipticity
%               data for each of the 'p' polarization states that was
%               searched. The entries in 'Q' refer to the row index of this
%               'polarization look-up table'. The polarization states are
%               currently hard-coded in this script but can easily be
%               extended to include arbitrarily exotic states.
% 
% 
% 
% NOTES ======================
% Convention about the DOPOLAR flag. Routine was not run using cartesian
% coordinates in a looong time.
% kr  == kx
% kth == ky
% 
% 
% This function is part of a package for three-component wavenumber
% analysis. A possible workflow to use this package comes in the form of
% two sequential scripts that can be run.
